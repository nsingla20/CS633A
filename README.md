# CS633A (Parallel Computing)
## Instructor: Prof. Preeti Malakar

This repositor contains the code and submission pdf for the course CS633, done in 2022-23 II sem at IIT-K. The assignments were done in a team of two (Naman ["nsingla"](https://github.com/nsingla20) Singla and me, Nishant ["NishantRoshan"](https://github.com/NishantRoshan) Roshan). Brief description of the assignments is given below:

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/NishantRoshan/CS633A/tree/main/assign1): Based on performance comparison of blocking point to point communication vis-a-vis change in data sizes and varing the computation nodes.
* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/NishantRoshan/CS633A/tree/main/assign2): Based on timings comparison of 1D and 2D domain decomposition of a matrix and then performing computations on lower triangular matrix.
